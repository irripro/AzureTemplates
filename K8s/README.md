To deploy a replication Controller: ```kubectl create -f nginx-multi.yaml```

To get replication controller: ```kubectl get rc```

To delete a replication controller ```kubectl delete rc nginx-www```

Sample service config file (YAML)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8000
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector: 
    app: nginx
```

To deploy a service: ```kubectl create -f nginx-service.yaml```

To get services: ```kubectl get svc```
```shell
$ kubectl get svc
NAME            CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes      10.0.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    3d
nginx-service   10.0.138.251   <none>        8000/TCP   3m
```

To test service: ```wget -qO- 10.0.0.138.251:8000```

To describe service deployed: ```kubectl describe svc nginx-service```

To run temp pods from command line: ```kubectl run mysample --image=latest123/apache```

To delete a running deployment: ```kubectl delete deployment mysample```

To run multiple read replicas of a pod with labels: ```kubectl run myreplicas --image=latest123/apache --replicas=2 --labels=app=myapache,version=1.0```

To run a specific command on a pod: ```kubectl exec myapache hostname```

To run a specific command on a specific pod: ```kubectl exec myapache -c <CID> hostname```

To interactively attach to a pod (without using kubectl attach): ```kubectl exec myapache -it -- /bin/bash```

To get logs from a running pod with 1 container: ```kubectl logs myapache```

To tail the logs from a container: ```kubectl logs --tail=1 myapache```

To show logs for the previous N time: ```kubectl logs --since=(1s/1m/1h/1d) myapache```

To follow the logs on a specific pod: ```kubectl logs -f myapache```

To follow logs of a spcific pod: ```kubectl -f -c CID myapache```

Run run a pod image from commandline: ```kubectl run myautoscale --image=latest123/apache --port=80 --labels=app=myautoscale```

To apply a autoscaling policy to a deployment: ```kubectl autoscale deployment myautoscale --min=2 --max=6```

To modify an existing autoscaling policy: ```kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=4 deployment/myautoscale```

Important Note:   
*   Once a pod is instantiated on a node it will stay there until it is deleted
    * Meaning once a pod on a host goes down. it will **not** be moved over to another node.
    * **If the node goes down all the pods running on the node will be down and they will not come up on the other nodes**
    * **Once a node comes back up the deployed pods will come back up. Nothing will be redeployed**
    * **This means its important to keep track of node health so that deployments/pods can be scaled out incase of failure to nodes**
